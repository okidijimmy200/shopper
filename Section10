Lecture 1:
Displaying the auction view::
--The view for displaying a single auction will contain the core functionality of the
real-time auction and bidding features for the marketplace.

--Before getting into the implementation of real-time bidding, we will set up the full-stack slice for retrieving
details of a single auction and display these details in a React component that will
house the auction display, timer, and bidding capabilities.

The read auction API::
--To display the details of an existing auction in a view of its own, we need to add a
backend API that will receive a request for the auction from the client and return its
details in the response.

The Auction component::
--We will implement an Auction component to fetch and display the details of a single
auction to the end user. This view will also have real-time update functionalities that
will render based on the current state of the auction and on whether the user viewing
the page is signed in.

--Auction component route can be used in any component to link to a specific auction

Lecture 2:
Adding the Timer component::
--When the auction is live, we will give the users a real-time update of how long they
have before bidding ends on this given auction. We will implement a Timer
component and conditionally render it in the Auction component to achieve this
feature.
--timer will count down the seconds and show how much time is left to the
users viewing the live auction.

--The remaining time decreases per second as the user is viewing the live auction. We
will implement this countdown feature in the Timer component, which is added to
the Auction component

--The Auction component provides it with props containing
the auction end time value, as well as a function to update the auction view when the
time ends.

--These props will be used in the Timer component to calculate time left and to update
the view when time is up.

--As a result, the timeLeft value will keep updating every second until the timeEnd
value is true. When the timeEnd value does become true as the time is up, we will
execute the update function that's sent in the props from the Auctions component
