Lecture 1:
Displaying the auction view::
--The view for displaying a single auction will contain the core functionality of the
real-time auction and bidding features for the marketplace.

--Before getting into the implementation of real-time bidding, we will set up the full-stack slice for retrieving
details of a single auction and display these details in a React component that will
house the auction display, timer, and bidding capabilities.

The read auction API::
--To display the details of an existing auction in a view of its own, we need to add a
backend API that will receive a request for the auction from the client and return its
details in the response.

The Auction component::
--We will implement an Auction component to fetch and display the details of a single
auction to the end user. This view will also have real-time update functionalities that
will render based on the current state of the auction and on whether the user viewing
the page is signed in.

--Auction component route can be used in any component to link to a specific auction
