Lecture 1:
Introducing cart, payments, and orders in the MERN Marketplace

Implementing a shopping cart::
--Implementing a shopping cart
Visitors to the MERN Marketplace can add products they wish to buy to a shopping
cart by clicking the add to cart button on each product. A cart icon on the menu will
indicate the number of products that have already been added to their cart as the user
continues to browse through the marketplace. They can also update the cart's
contents and begin the checkout process by opening the cart view. But to complete
the checkout process and place an order, users will be required to sign in.

--The shopping cart is mainly a frontend feature, so the cart details will be stored
locally on the client side until the user places the order at checkout. To implement the
shopping cart features, we will set up helper methods in client/cart/carthelper.
js that will help manipulate the cart details from relevant React
components

Adding to the cart::


Cart icon in the menu::
--In the menu, we will add a link to the cart view, as well as a badge that displays the
length of the cart array stored in localStorage in order to visually inform the user
of how many items are currently in their cart.

The cart view::
--The cart view will contain the cart items and checkout details. But initially, only the
cart details will be displayed until the user is ready to check out.

The CartItems component::
--The CartItems component will allow the user to view and update the items
currently in their cart. It will also give them the option to start the checkout process if
they are signed in.

Retrieving cart details::

Modifying quantity::
--Each cart item displayed in the cart view will contain an editable TextField that will
allow the user to update the quantity for each product they are buying, with a
minimum allowed value of 1,

Removing items::
--Each item in the cart will have a remove option next to it. This remove item option is
a button that, when clicked, passes the array index of the item to the removeItem
method so that it can be removed from the array.

Showing the total price::
--At the bottom of the CartItems component, we will display the total price of the
items in the cart.

Option to check out::
--The user will see the option to perform the checkout depending on whether they are
signed in and whether the checkout has already been opened,

--Once the checkout value is set to true in the Cart view, the Checkout component
will be rendered to allow the user to enter the checkout details and place an order.
This will complete the buying process for a user, who is now able to add items to
their shopping cart and modify each item until they are ready to checkout.
