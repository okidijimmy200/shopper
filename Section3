Adding products to shops
--In the MERN
Marketplace, sellers can manage products in their shops, and visitors can search for
and browse products. While we will implement the features to allow authorized
sellers to add, modify, and delete products from their shops, we will also incorporate
features to list products in ways that are meaningful to the end user

--we will retrieve and display products by a specific shop, products related
to a given product, and the latest products added to the marketplace.

--we will build out the product module incorporating these features by first
defining a product model for storing product data in the database, and
then implementing the backend APIs and frontend views for the product-related
features including adding new products to a shop, rendering different lists of
products, displaying a single product, editing products, and deleting products.

Lecture 1:
Defining a Product model
--Products will be stored in a product collection in the database. To implement this, we
will add a Mongoose model to define a Product model for storing the details of each
product.

Lecture 2:
Creating a new product:
--Sellers in MERN Marketplace will be able to add new products to the shops they own
on the platform.

The create product API::

--to make a POST request to the create
API by passing the multipart form data from the view. This fetch method can then
be utilized in the React component, which takes the product details from the user and
sends the request to create a new product.

The NewProduct component::
--An authorized seller who already has a shop created in the marketplace will see a
form view for adding new products to the shop. We will implement this form view in
a React component named NewProduct. The NewProduct component will be similar
to the NewShop component. It will contain a form that allows a seller to create a
product by entering a name, description, category, quantity, and price, and to upload
a product image file from their local filesystem,
