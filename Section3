Adding products to shops
--In the MERN
Marketplace, sellers can manage products in their shops, and visitors can search for
and browse products. While we will implement the features to allow authorized
sellers to add, modify, and delete products from their shops, we will also incorporate
features to list products in ways that are meaningful to the end user

--we will retrieve and display products by a specific shop, products related
to a given product, and the latest products added to the marketplace.

--we will build out the product module incorporating these features by first
defining a product model for storing product data in the database, and
then implementing the backend APIs and frontend views for the product-related
features including adding new products to a shop, rendering different lists of
products, displaying a single product, editing products, and deleting products.

Lecture 1:
Defining a Product model
--Products will be stored in a product collection in the database. To implement this, we
will add a Mongoose model to define a Product model for storing the details of each
product.
