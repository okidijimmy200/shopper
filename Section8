Lecture 1:
APIs for products ordered::
--Allowing sellers to update the status of a product will require having to set up four
different APIs, including an API to retrieve the possible status values. Then, the
actual status update actions will need APIs to handle updates to the order itself as the
status is changed in order to initiate related actions, such as increasing the stock
quantity of a canceled product, and to create a charge on the customer's credit card
when a product is being processed. In the following sections, we will look at the API
implementations for retrieving possible status values, updating an order status,
canceling a product order, and processing a charge for an ordered product.

Get status values::
--The possible status values of an ordered product are set as enums in the CartItem
schema.

Update order status::
--When a product's status is changed to any value other than Processing or Cancelled,
a PUT request to '/api/order/status/:shopId' will directly update the order in
the database, given that the current user is the verified owner of the shop with the
ordered product.
