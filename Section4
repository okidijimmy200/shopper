Lecture 1:
Editing and deleting a product
--Implementations to edit and delete products in the application are similar to editing
and deleting shops

Edit::
--The edit functionality is very similar to the create product functionality we
implemented earlier. The EditProduct form component, which can be implemented
to render a form that allows product detail modification, will also only be accessible
by verified sellers

--This implementation of an edit product form view integrated with an update API in
the backend will allow shop owners to modify the details of products in their shops
