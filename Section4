Lecture 1:
Editing and deleting a product
--Implementations to edit and delete products in the application are similar to editing
and deleting shops

Edit::
--The edit functionality is very similar to the create product functionality we
implemented earlier. The EditProduct form component, which can be implemented
to render a form that allows product detail modification, will also only be accessible
by verified sellers

--This implementation of an edit product form view integrated with an update API in
the backend will allow shop owners to modify the details of products in their shops

Delete::
--In order to implement the delete product functionality, we can implement
a DeleteProduct component similar to the DeleteShop component, and add it to
the MyProducts component for each product in the list. It can take the product
object, shopID, and an onRemove method as a prop from MyProducts,

--The component will function the same as DeleteShop, opening a dialog for
confirmation on button-click and then, when the delete intent is confirmed by the
user, calling the fetch method for delete, which makes the DELETE request to the
server at /api/product/:shopId/:productId.
