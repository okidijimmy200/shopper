--Adding auctions to the marketplace
--Displaying the auction view
--Implementing real-time bidding with Socket.IO

Lecture 1:
Introducing real-time bidding in the MERN Marketplace.
--In this chapter, we
will extend these functionalities to allow sellers to create auctions for items that other
users can place bids on in a fixed duration of time. The auction view will describe the
item for sale and let signed in users place bids when the auction is live.

--Different users can place their own bids, and also see other users placing bids in real-time, with
the view updating accordingly.

Adding auctions to the marketplace::
--we will allow a user who is signed in and has an active seller account to create auctions for items that they want other users to place bids on.
--To enable the features of adding and managing auctions, we will need to define how
to store auction details and implement the full-stack slices that will let users create,
access and update auctions on the platform.

Defining an Auction model::
--The Auction Schema in this model will have fields to store auction details
such as the name and description of the item being auctioned, along with an image
and a reference to the seller creating this auction. It will also have fields that specify
the start and end time for bidding on this auction, a starting value for bids, and the
list of bids that have been placed for this auction.

--These auction-related fields will allow us to implement auction and bidding-related
features for the MERN Marketplace application.
