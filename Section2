Lecture 1:
Displaying a shop::
--Any users visiting MERN Marketplace will be able to browse through each individual
shop. In the following sections, we will implement the individual shop view by
adding a read shop API to the backend, a way to call this API from the frontend, and
the React component that will display the shop details in the view.

The read a shop API::
--read shop API GET route that queries the Shop collection with an ID and returns the shop in the
response.

Lecture 2:
The Shop component::
--The Shop component will render the shop details and also a list of products in the
specified shop using a product list component, which will be discussed in
the Products section.

--To implement this Shop component, we will first retrieve the shop details with a fetch
call to the read API in a useEffect hook, and set the received values to state

This useEffect hook will only run when the shopId changes in the route params.
